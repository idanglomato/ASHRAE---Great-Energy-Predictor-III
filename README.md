# ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III

## Description
Significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. So, are the improvements working? Thatâ€™s where data scientist come in.

Developing energy savings has two key elements: Forecasting future energy usage without improvements, and forecasting energy use after a specific set of improvements have been implemented. One issue preventing more aggressive growth of the energy markets are the lack of cost-effective, accurate, and scalable procedures for forecasting energy use.

In this project, the task is to develop accurate predictions of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, natural gas, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe.

With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies. More accurate models could support better market incentives and enable lower cost financing.

## Objectives
Build counterfactual models across four energy types based on historic usage rates and observed weather.
